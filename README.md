# AuntieTuna

AuntieTuna is a browser extension that checks if each visited page is a
potential phishing website based on snapshots of known good websites
that a user adds.

For example, a user adds a snapshot of Bank of FooBar. The extension
then checks every other page the user visits to see if it looks like
Bank of FooBarâ€“if it does, it's likely phish and blocked.

A paper describing the details and usability of AuntieTuna can be found
online:

> Content-Based Phishing Detection**. *Proceedings of the NDSS Workshop
> on Usable Security* (San Diego, California, USA, Feb. 2016).

## installation

There are multiple ways to install the AuntieTuna browser extension via
sideloading.

[Information about the requested permissions](#TODO).

### firefox

**TODO** instructions will differ on stable, beta, nightly, developer

### chrome / chromium

**TODO**

1. Go to Extensions (Window -> Extensions) or "chrome://extensions"
2. Click on "Load unpacked extensions..."
3. Select the directory containing this extension and click on "Select"
4. To view debugging information for the extension on a visited webpage,
   go to View -> Developer -> JavaScript Console

### development (firefox)

Running the development version will launch Firefox with a clean,
temporary profile with AuntieTuna pre-installed that is independent of
existing profiles you may have.

Data is ***not saved*** after you close Firefox! (You can uncomment the
line containing `--keep-profile-changes` if you want a persistent
profile.)

1. Install Mozilla Firefox
2. Install `web-ext`
3. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/cardi/auntietuna.git`
4. (optional) In `run.sh`, modify the paths to `FIREFOX_BIN` and `FIREFOX_DIST`
5. Execute `run.sh`

## usage

On a website you normally log in to, click on the shield icon and
"Add to Good List".

The extension now checks, behind the scenes, if every visited webpage is
phish or not. If it is, you'll be prevented from clicking through.

**NOTE**: Software is in ALPHA stage! There *might* be false positives
and/or broken websites. Please send feedback to <calvin@isi.edu>.
