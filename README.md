# AuntieTuna

AuntieTuna is a browser extension that checks if each visited page is a
potential phishing website based on snapshots of known good websites
that a user adds.

For example, a user adds a snapshot of Bank of FooBar. The extension
then checks every other page the user visits to see if it looks like
Bank of FooBarâ€“if it does, it's likely phish and blocked.

A paper describing the details and usability of AuntieTuna can be found
online:

> Content-Based Phishing Detection**. *Proceedings of the NDSS Workshop
